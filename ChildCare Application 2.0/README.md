# ChildCareApp

This program is an application designed to handle day to day billing and logging information for a childcare facility.  
It allows guardians to check their children in and out of the childcare facility, and creates a charge based on the time 
the child spent there and the type of service that was being provided. Charges are recorded and a balance is stored for
each guardian, as well as detailed billing records.

This application is coded in C# and was created using visual studio 2013 Ultimate edition.  A SQLite or MySQL database is 
also used, depending on the program version.
