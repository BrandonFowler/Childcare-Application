# ChildCareApp
CSCD 488/490 class project

This program is an application to handle day to day billing and logging information for the Spokane Club Childcare facilities.  It allows parents to check their children in and out of the childcare facility and creates a charge based on the time the child spent there and the type of service that was being provided.

This application is coded in C# and was created using visual studio 2013 Ultimate edition.  A SQLite database is also used.
